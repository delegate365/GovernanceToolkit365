# Newsletter

This page informs about how to use the Governance Toolkit 365 (GT365) and the built-in newsletter system.

The GT365 newsletters can be sent automatically to predefined admins or group owners. Currently, there are these newsletters available:

- Ownerless Groups
- Group Guests

Each newsletter can be sent to a group of Administrators on a daily, weekly or monthly basis. The subject and the email body can be defined as needed. To configure the newsletter, download the newsletter templates and contact atwork for setting the desired configuration.
