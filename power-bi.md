# Power-BI

These pages inform about how to use the Governance Toolkit 365 (GT365) with Microsoft Power-BI.

You can download the desktop client at the [Power-BI website](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/). You can download a GT365 dashboard sample zip-file from [here](https://governancetoolkit365.com/download/GovernanceToolkit365-Template.zip).

We assume, the data for your tenant has already been generated, and you have got the Azure Storage Account name and key. You need that data to access your generated statistics.

## Connect to your data

Follow these steps to get your own data visualized in Power-BI.

- Extract the [zip file](https://governancetoolkit365.com/download/GovernanceToolkit365-Template.zip).
- Open the dashboard file *GovernanceToolkit365-Template.pbit* with your Power-BI desktop client. When Power-BI tries to update the content, an error can occur. If this message happens, simply click on "Close".
