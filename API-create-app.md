- Login to the Azure Portal as Global Admin and navigate to [Active Directory / App registrations](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/RegisteredApps).

- Click on "Application permission".
[![link](./images/app-registration-8.png)](./images/app-registration-8.png "Click to enlarge")
- Search for "group". In the group section, find the "Group.ReadWrite.All" permission and select it. This permission is required to read and to create new groups and teams.
[![link](./images/app-registration-9.png)](./images/app-registration-9.png "Click to enlarge")
- Search for "user". In the user section, find the "User.Read.All" permission and the "User.Invite.All" permission and select both. This is required to add owners to a new group and to invite guest users. Then, click "Add permissions" to save the settings.

- Check the permissions, they should set as in the following screenshot. Wait for up to 10 seconds, then click "Grant admin consent for [your organization]". This allows this application to execute tasks with the defined permissions.

- Confirm the consent "Do you want to grant consent for the requested permissions for all accounts in Contoso? This will update any existing admin consent records this application already has to match what is listed below."

- The application permissions should be granted now and look as here.
[![link](./images/app-registration-13.png)](./images/app-registration-13.png "Click to enlarge")
- We need to copy the AppID and the TenantID together with the secret. We need that data later.
[![link](./images/app-registration-14.png)](./images/app-registration-14.png "Click to enlarge")
- Done with the app registration. This is a one-time step. We can now work with that app.

You should now have the app data saved somewhere, similar as here:

| Key | Value |
|:----|:------|
| AppID | 91eef8ad...
| AppSecret | /95=BRZ...
| TenantID | 21e6f8d3...
